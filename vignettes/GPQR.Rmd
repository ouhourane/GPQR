# Installation

Like many other R packages, the simplest way to obtain GPQR is to install it  from github. Type the following command in R console:

```{r setup}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/ouhourane/GPQR.git")
```

In this vignette, we demonstrate how to use the GSQR() and cv.GSQR() functions in the GPQR
package to fit the regularization path of parametric quantile regression with grouped penalties. 
This includes group selection methods such as group Lasso, group Mcp, and group Scad. 
The others function: predict(), coef(), cv.predict, cv.coef, ... are minor modifications or directly copied from the glmnet package.


# Bardet dataset

Gene expression data (20 genes for 120 samples) from the microarray experiments 
of mammalian eye tissue samples of Scheetz et al. (2006).
This data set contains 120 samples with 100 predictors 
(expanded from 20 genes using 5 basis B-splines, as described in Yang, Y. and Zou, H. (2012)).

```{r bardet}
library(GPQR)
#load bardet dataset
data(bardet)
group <- rep(1:20,each=5)
#run GPQR for group Lasso penaly, taux = 0.5 and  with the penalty group Lasso 
#and the first pseudo-quantile approximation loss function 
fit <- GPQR(x=bardet$x,y=bardet$y,group=group,method="GLasso",check="f1",taux=0.5)
# To produce a coefficient profile plot of the coefficient paths for a fitted GPQR object.
plot(fit)
```

"fit" is an object of class GPQR that contains all the relevant information of the fitted the QR for further use.
To extract the extract the information from "fit", various functions are provided for the
this object such as plot, print, coef and predict that enable us to run easily those tasks.

# Example 1 of our paper: Group Penalized Quantile Regression

In this example, our goal is to illustrate  graphically the key advantages of using group penalized 
quantile regression approaches to detect heterogeneous effects of predictors, 
as alternatives to group penalized Least-Square (LS) regression methods.

 We set the sample size to $n=100$ observations and $p=20$ predictors. The predictors $X_j, j=1,\ldots,20$, were generated as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We generated $Z_j, j=1,\ldots,11,$ following the standard normal distribution;
    \item We set $X_j = Z_1 + \epsilon_j^x, j=1,\ldots,4, \epsilon_j^x \sim N(0,0.1)$; 
    \item $X_j = Z_2 + \epsilon_j^x, j=5,\ldots,8, \epsilon_j^x \sim N(0,0.1)$; 
    \item $X_j = Z_3 + \epsilon_j^x, j=9,\ldots,12, \epsilon_j^x \sim N(0,0.1)$; 
    \item $X_{j} = Z_{j-9}, j=13,\ldots,20$.
\end{itemize}
Thus, we set the predictors' effects to be
$$
\mathbf{\beta} =
(\underbrace{3,3,3,3}_{G_1},\underbrace{2,2,2,2}_{G_2},\underbrace{-1,-1,-1,-1}_{G_3},\underbrace{0,\ldots,0}_{G_4-G_{11}})^\top
$$
and $\sigma = 3$. The response $Y$ is generated from the following location-scale linear regression model
$$Y = \sum_{j=1}^{20} \beta_j X_j + \Phi(X_{20})\epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim N(0,3),$$
where $\Phi(.)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.

The  function "GPQR_illustration" produces a coefficient profile plot of the 
coefficient paths for a fitted GPQR object. We run this function for different 
parameters.


```{r GPQR_tau_0.95}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
GPQR_illustration("GLasso", 0.95)
GPQR_illustration("GMcp", 0.95)
GPQR_illustration("GScad", 0.95)
```

```{r GPQR_tau_0.50}
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
GPQR_illustration("GLasso", 0.50)
GPQR_illustration("GMcp", 0.50)
GPQR_illustration("GScad", 0.50)
```

The function "grpreg_illustration" produces a coefficient profile plot of the 
coefficient paths for a fitted grpreg object. We run this function for different penalties: 


```{r grpreg_illustration_plot}
xlm=c(-3,7)
par(mfrow = c(1,3))
grpreg_illustration("grLasso")
grpreg_illustration("grMCP")
grpreg_illustration("grSCAD")
```

The figures above show  that the coefficients' profiles of the GPQR with $\tau \in \{0.50, 0.95\}$ tend to be smooth, however, the LS paths fluctuate widely, and some coefficients are in opposite directions/signs to their true values.

# Gene-based analysis of the DNA methylation data near the {\it BLK} gene

This real example illustrates the GPQR approach performance for binary classification 
using DNA methylation around the {\it BLK} gene, located in chromosome 8, to detect 
differentially methylated regions (DMRs). DMRs refer to genomic regions with 
significantly different methylation levels between two groups of samples. 
The data consists of methylation levels of 5,986 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides 
within a genomic region of 2 million base pairs. 
The methylation levels in these CpG sites (predictors) are measured in 40 samples
using bisulfite sequencing

Importing "PCEV.RData" data into R  from Github

```{r import_data}
#load "PCEV.RData" from github
load(url("https://github.com/ouhourane/GPQR/raw/main/data/PCEV.RData"))
ylab = expression(beta~'value')
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
set.seed(123)
```

The function "plot_grpreg" produce the optimal value  for the regression coefficients of 
the grpreg-methods with the three group penalties (GMCP, GSCAD, and Glasso) 
are shown as a function of the genomic position. We run this function 
for different penalties: 

```{r plot_grpreg}
plot_grpreg("grLasso")
plot_grpreg("grMCP")
plot_grpreg("grSCAD")
```

The function "plot_GPQR" produce the optimal value  for the regression coefficients of 
the GPQR-methods with the three group penalties (GMCP, GSCAD, and Glasso) 
are shown as a function of the genomic position. We run this function 
for $\tau = 0.5$ and three penalties: 

```{r plot_GPQR}
plot_GPQR("GLasso",0.5)
plot_GPQR("GMcp",0.5)
plot_GPQR("GScad",0.5)
```

As we can see, the region around 11.3 Mb with size 150kb 
(i.e., the region delimited by the two vertical lines) is detected/selected by 
the quantile regression methods, but not with the LS approach.
